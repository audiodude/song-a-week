-*- What now? -*-
Now you will start receiving emails reminding you to work on your song every
week. Once you have composed and recorded something for the week, you can
uploaded it to the site using the form at: {URL pending}. This will ensure
that you are marked as participating in the week's challenge and that you
remain in good standing on the site.

Weekly submissions are archived and aggregated for other member and random
visitors to enjoy, but only if you mark them public (which we hope you'll
do).

If you have any questions, you can email Travis the site administrator directly at audiodude@gmail.com.

Thanks, and we look forward to composing music alongside you!
