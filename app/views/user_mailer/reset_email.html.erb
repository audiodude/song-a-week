	<h2>Reset your password</h2>
	<p>
		Someone (hopefully you) has requested a password reset for the Song-A-Week
		(songs.0-z-0.com) account associated with this email address.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this was you, and you wish to reset your password, follow this link and
		choose a new password on the page:<br/>
		<%= link_to reset_path(token: @token, only_path: false), reset_path(token: @token, only_path: false) %></a>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you <em>didn't</em> request this password reset, simply ignore this email
		and nothing will happen.
	</p>
  <p>
   If you have any questions, you can email Travis the site administrator directly at <a href="mailto:audiodude@gmail.com">audiodude@gmail.com</a>.
